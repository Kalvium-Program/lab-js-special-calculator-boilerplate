# Kalvium Lab | Special Calculator

Terence Tao loves Mathematics. So he decided to create one special calculator, which behaves a little
different to normal calculators.
Tao is now on a quest to create this special calculator. He needs **YOU** to help him code functionalities in the back-end though. Go to the `src/app.js` file and complete all the unfinished code to satiate her sweet tooth.

## What should you do
```
Fork this repo
Clone this repo
Practice JavaScript Arrays - higher order function
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Kalvium ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your Kalvium Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

## Starter code

The `src/app.js` contains an array of 100 chocolates. We are talking about the 100 _strings_ that specifies the color of each chocolate. Available chocolates are of the colors `green, red, purple, blue, crimson, silver, pink`.

Every function will take the `chocolates` array as it's first input by default.

### Tests

As usual, open the `index.html` (outside src folder) file on your browser and start coding to pass the test. Remember to focus on one test at a time and read carefully the instructions to understand what you have to do.

### Progression 1: Special Addition!

Simple Addition bores Tao, so he decided to revert it's role, by subtracting when addition method is called. Create a function `specialAddition()` that takes `numberOne, numberTwo` as arguments, and returns
_the addition of those two numbers_.

### Progression 2: Simple Division!

Tao loves division, so he kept everything simple and normal - so division works as division should work!
Create a function `simpleDivision()` that takes `numberOne, numberTwo` as arguments, and returns
_the division of those two numbers_.

### Progression 3: Special Calculator!

Tao just wanted the special addition and simple division methods for his special calculator. So now he wants to create his calculator in such a way, that as soon as any of the two operations are called, the 
respective operation is done - in the way he have defined those operations.
Create a function `specialCalculator()` that takes `numberOne, numberTwo, operation` as an argument, and returns _the respective output from the respective operation called_.

### Challenge : If-Else or Something Else!

Try not to use if-else -> for implementing this special calculator.



Happy Coding Kalvium ❤️
